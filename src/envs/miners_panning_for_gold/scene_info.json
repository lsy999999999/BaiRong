            "interaction_patterns": "Agents submit action bundles each round, including claims, raids, defense, and mining, subject to legality and budget constraints.",

        "MinerAgent": "Responsible for maximizing personal cumulative gold by engaging in actions such as mining, claiming plots, and defending resources within budget constraints.",
        "ClaimAgent": "Focuses on expanding territory by claiming unowned plots, ensuring strategic control over valuable resources.",
        "RaiderAgent": "Specializes in predation by raiding other agents' plots to acquire resources, balancing aggression with stamina budget.",
        "DefenderAgent": "Prioritizes protection of owned plots from raids, allocating stamina to defensive actions to secure resources.",
        "StrategistAgent": "Utilizes decision algorithms such as heuristics and opponent modeling to optimize action selection and resource allocation."
