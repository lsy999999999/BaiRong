        "overview": {
            "system_goal": "Simulate a gold-mining scenario to test whether, under homogeneous land and identical agent stamina with non-depleting resources but per-round extraction caps, agents spontaneously form relatively stable plot ownership (property right stability improved and conflict rate reduced), achieve high total output (efficiency gains), exhibit a trade-off between concentration (inequality) and stability, and whether LLM agents evolve first possession or recognize-first-possession behavioral rules while each agent individually maximizes its own payoff.",
            "agent_types": "All agents are homogeneous miners controlled by LLM decision modules; each has identical per-round stamina S that refreshes to S=10 at the start of every round (no carryover and unused stamina is lost), identical capabilities, no direct communication, and no centralized authority; each LLM’s objective is to maximize its own payoff (own gold), not social welfare.",
            "environment_description": "A 10×10 grid map with 100 plots; time is discrete and round-based with recommended R=200 rounds (robustness checks at R=100 and R=500); resources are non-depleting but each plot has a per-round mining cap M_CAP=3 in integer stamina units; per plot per round payoff equals min(allocated mining stamina, 3) × α with default α=1 gold per stamina.",
            "ownership_and_property_rules_summary": "Per round and per plot, ownership is unique; initially all plots are unowned; newly claimed plots receive a same-round truce window (default truce=1 round) preventing raids during the acquisition round; owners can precommit to defend plots each round at stamina cost; undefended plots can be raided and ownership reassigned via concurrent resolution rules.",
            "rewards_and_payoffs_summary": "Mining yields min(stamina invested per owned plot, 3) × 1 gold each round; theoretical per-round maximum output is 100 plots × cap 3 = 300 gold; stamina budget S refreshes each round to 10 (explicit emphasis: at the start of every round, S is reset to 10 irrespective of prior usage), and unused stamina does not carry over; there are no monetary costs apart from stamina expenditures; each LLM agent’s objective is to maximize its own payoff measured in gold, typically cumulative over rounds.",
            "observability_and_memory_summary": "Publicly visible at the start of each round: the full current ownership map across 100 plots and last round’s public events per plot (defended, raided, success, contention), with optional K=5 round summaries; private information includes each agent’s own cumulative gold and own action history; agents may maintain internal memory but the platform input limits context to the current public state plus a brief summary.",
            "evaluation_goals_and_hypotheses": "Baseline tests in homogeneous conditions target spontaneous formation of stable plot ownership with reduced conflicts, high aggregate output relative to the 300 per-round theoretical maximum, potential trade-off between concentration and stability, and emergence of first possession norms from LLM behavior; expectation: with defense precommitment and per-round mining cap making raiding less profitable than stable mining, conflict should decrease and property rights should stabilize over time.",
            "research_design_scope": "Primary analysis in completely homogeneous settings (identical plots, identical S=10 refreshed each round, non-depleting resources with per-plot cap) followed by systematic treatments and ablations including truce window toggles, defense strength variants, stamina and cap variations, population density changes, history visibility, extended heterogeneity (α and S), and enabling communication or authority for robustness checks."
        },
        "design_concepts": {
            "interaction_patterns": "Agents interact indirectly by claiming unowned plots, raiding owned plots, defending owned plots, and mining exclusive to current owners; conflicts occur when multiple agents claim the same unowned plot (resolved via seeded RNG) or when they raid an owned plot (defense may block all raids; otherwise single or multiple raiders may seize ownership via seeded tie-breaks); newly acquired plots cannot be mined the same round by the new owner.",
            "communication_protocols": "No communication among agents and no authority to adjudicate disputes or impose punishments in the baseline; variants may introduce communication or authority for robustness and mechanism testing.",
            "decision_mechanisms": "Each round, agents submit an ordered action list specifying defend (on owned plots), mine (0..3 per owned plot), claim (on unowned plots), and raid (on others’ plots), with total stamina cost ≤ S; the platform removes illegal actions then deterministically prunes from the tail to satisfy the budget, preserving agent-declared priorities; S refreshes to exactly 10 at the start of every round; agents allocate stamina strategically to maximize their own payoff (own gold), balancing defense, mining, claiming, and raiding under the per-plot mining cap and defense rules.",
            "concurrency_and_timing": "All agents act simultaneously; Step 0 submission, cleaning, and tail pruning; Step 1 resolve claims with seeded RNG ties and grant same-round truce; Step 2 resolve raids on owned plots not in truce with defense fully blocking any number of raiders by default and seeded tie-breaks among multiple raiders on undefended plots; Step 3 settle mining for final owners using predeclared mining allocations with per-plot cap; Step 4 log the round and clear defense flags.",
            "stochasticity_and_reproducibility": "All randomness is seeded and reproducible using a global seed combined with round number, plot coordinates, and event type (Claim or Raid) to initialize RNG for each tie-break; participants are ordered by agent ID ascending before seeded drawing; map scanning order is fixed row-major from (0,0) to (9,9); logs and snapshots store per-round states and RNG order for complete reproducibility.",
            "norms_and_behavioral_rules_of_interest": "Target regularities include reduced raiding against stable holders (empirical respect for first possession), convergence of stamina allocation shares across defend, raid, mine, claim over time, and strategic shifts that reduce conflict and enhance efficiency under the defense precommitment and mining cap regime.",
            "feedback_and_observed_signals": "Agents observe the current ownership map, last-round per-plot events, and optional K=5 summaries plus their own cumulative gold; these signals, together with fixed rules and the reset S=10 budget each round, guide adaptation toward maximizing individual payoff.",
            "experimental_controls_and_baselines": "Comparative baselines include Random (uniformly random stamina allocation), Greedy-Mine (mine first if owning any plots, then claim/raid), Defend-then-Mine (defend all owned plots before mining and only then claim/raid), and Tit-for-tat-Raid (retaliate against recent raiders) to probe conflict persistence and the value of defense precommitment.",
            "tradeoffs_and_theoretical_expectations": "Short-run raiding gains may be dominated by stable mining returns due to the per-plot cap and the ability to precommit defense at low cost; expect a trade-off between distributional concentration (inequality in gold or holdings) and stability, with conflict intensity declining and efficiency rising over time under homogeneous conditions with S resetting to 10 each round."
        },
        "details": {
            "agent_behaviors": "Per round, each agent chooses an ordered list of actions with integer stamina costs summing to ≤ S; Claim targets unowned plots at cost 1 per plot; Raid targets plots owned by others at cost 1 per plot; Defend allows owners to precommit defense per owned plot at cost 1 per defended plot (the cost is incurred even if no raid occurs); Mine allocates 0..3 stamina per owned plot subject to per-plot cap M_CAP=3 for rewards; agents may combine defend and mine on the same plot (e.g., defend=1 plus mine=1 costs 2); agents cannot defend or mine plots they do not own, cannot target non-existent coordinates, and cannot mine newly captured plots in the same round they are captured; stamina budget S refreshes every round to exactly 10 (explicit emphasis), and unused stamina does not carry over; each LLM aims to maximize its own payoff in gold, typically by maximizing expected cumulative gold over the horizon.",
            "decision_algorithms": "Platform enforces legality and budget via a two-stage process: first remove illegal actions (e.g., mining or defending a non-owned plot, invalid coordinates, condense duplicates), then compute total stamina cost and prune deterministically from the tail until total cost ≤ S=10; if defense precommitments alone exceed S, the same tail-pruning applies across all categories; in the rare case that pruning to an empty plan still leaves an infeasible budget due to pathological input, the agent performs no actions and consumes 0 stamina for that round; action processing pipeline: Step 0 submission, cleaning, and budget pruning; Step 1 claims on unowned plots with seeded RNG tie-breakers and same-round truce to new owners; Step 2 raids on owned plots not in truce, with defense fully blocking any number of raiders by default and undefended plots changing ownership via deterministic or RNG tie-breaks; Step 3 mining for final owners using predeclared mining allocations, with mining set to 0 for owners who lost a plot mid-round and with newly acquired plots not minable by the captor in the same round; Step 4 log and clear defense flags.",
            "specific_constraints": "Stamina S=10 per agent per round refreshes to 10 at the start of each round and does not carry over; claims and raids cost 1 stamina per targeted plot; defense costs 1 stamina per defended owned plot and is charged even if no raid occurs; mining allocations per owned plot are 0..3 stamina with per-plot cap M_CAP=3 applied to output; resources are non-depleting (R0 → ∞) but constrained by per-plot per-round cap; each plot can have at most one owner per round; newly claimed plots receive a same-round truce by default; newly captured plots cannot be mined by the captor in the same round; agents cannot communicate; there is no punitive or adjudicating authority in the baseline; map scanning is row-major from (0,0) to (9,9); tie-break participants are ordered by agent ID ascending for seeded RNG.",
            "information_interface_and_io": "Per round LLM input includes the 100-plot ownership map, the agent’s own ID, the agent’s cumulative gold, last round’s per-plot public events or a K=5 round summary, and current parameters S and M_CAP with explicit note that S is reset to 10 at round start; the prompt restates action types, stamina cost rules, budget and pruning rules, truce window setting, and the reward function; per round LLM output is an ordered action list encoded in JSON with categories defend (list of plot_ids), mine (list of plot_id with k in [0..3]), claim (list of plot_ids), raid (list of plot_ids); the sequence order encodes priority for deterministic tail-pruning to satisfy S.",
            "metrics_and_logging": "Per-round logs record per plot the owner ID, defended flag, raided flag, and whether ownership changed; per agent the stamina allocation across defend, raid, mine, claim, gold gained this round, and number of plots owned; global counts of claims, raids, defenses, successful raids, and total output; core evaluation metrics include property stability via plot turnover rate and property half-life, conflict intensity via raid rate, defense trigger rate, and raid success rate, efficiency via total output relative to 300 per round and idle stamina rate, distributional concentration via Gini of gold and HHI of plot ownership, and behavioral evolution via convergence of stamina shares and decreased raids against stable holders.",
            "treatments_and_ablation_studies": "Systematically vary single factors: truce window default 1 round versus 0; defense strength default defend=1 blocks unlimited raiders versus a variant where each point of defense counters exactly one incoming raid; stamina budget S ∈ {8, 10 (default), 12} with the default refreshing to 10 each round; mining cap M_CAP ∈ {2, 3 (default), 4}; population size N ∈ {10 (default), 20}; history visibility set to only last round, last 5 rounds (default), or full history; extended heterogeneity includes higher-α plots, stamina heterogeneity with S differing across agents, enabling or disabling communication, and introducing authority for adjudication or punishment.",
            "constraints_and_limits_restatement": "S refreshes to 10 at the start of every round and never carries over; action costs consume S; per-plot cap M_CAP=3 limits effective mining; exclusive ownership per plot per round; truce on newly claimed plots prevents same-round raids in the default; no same-round mining of newly captured plots; no communication or authority; randomness is seeded and reproducible; map scanning and agent ordering are fixed for determinism.",
            "baseline_and_comparison_policies": "Random (uniform random stamina allocation), Greedy-Mine (mine first if owning any plots, then claim/raid), Defend-then-Mine (defend all owned plots before mining and only then consider claim/raid), and Tit-for-tat-Raid (retaliate by raiding those who just raided me) serve as comparative baselines to test conflict persistence and the value of defense precommitment.",
            "success_criteria_and_hypothesis_tests": "Success requires that homogeneous settings exhibit stability with plot turnover rates significantly lower in the second half versus the first half and longer property half-life; efficiency with higher second-half output relative to the 300 per-round theoretical maximum and reduced idle stamina; conflict suppression with significantly lower second-half raid rates and more targeted defense; behavioral rules indicating LLM recognition of first possession via decreased raids on stable holders; results should hold across most random seeds and both N=10 and N=20 settings.",
            "run_configuration_and_repeats": "Use 20 random seeds per treatment and report mean ± 95% confidence intervals; recommended R=200 rounds with robustness checks at R=100 and R=500; tie-break participants are ordered by agent ID ascending; RNG initialization uses hash(seed_global, round, plot_id, event_type) for claim and raid tie-breaks; map scanning is row-major from (0,0) to (9,9); logs and complete snapshots are saved each round, including RNG order, to ensure full reproducibility."
