        "overview": {
            "system_goal": "Maximize global and individual cumulative gold production through strategic mining, occupying, and defending land in a 10x10 grid. The system aims to achieve an output close to 80% to 90% of the 'no-conflict pure mining upper limit'.",
            "agent_types": "Miners (N=10 or 20, two options).",
            "environment_description": "A 10x10 grid (100 plots) with homogeneous properties. Each plot can produce gold linearly up to a maximum of 3 units of mining effort per plot. Total gold stock remains constant, but there is a fixed limit on gold extraction per round. Each plot can produce up to 3 units of gold per round. The system operates over R=200 rounds with ≥30 independent random seeds.",
            "key1": "Each miner has a fixed energy budget of S (S=10) per round, which resets at the end of each round.",
            "key2": "Miners can occupy, mine, and defend plots. Occupying a plot costs 1 energy, mining costs up to 3 energy per plot, and defending a plot costs 1 energy."
        },
        "design_concepts": {
            "interaction_patterns": "Miners interact through occupying, mining, and defending plots. They can also challenge other miners for control of plots. Conflict rates show a declining trend and stabilize at a low level in the latter half of the rounds.",
            "communication_protocols": "No direct communication between miners. Miners can only observe the grid state, their own energy, and the mining function.",
            "decision_mechanisms": "Miners make decisions based on the current grid state, their own energy, and the mining function. They allocate energy to occupying, mining, and defending plots. They also decide whether to challenge other miners for control of plots.",
            "key1": "Miners can challenge other miners for control of plots, but the defender can prevent challenges by spending 1 energy on defense.",
            "key2": "If a defender does not spend energy on defense, a random challenger becomes the new occupier."
        },
        "details": {
            "agent_behaviors": "Miners observe the grid, allocate energy to occupying, mining, and defending plots, and challenge other miners for control of plots. They can also mine gold from their occupied plots. The average holding period increases, leading to more stable property rights. The end-of-round share distribution is statistically indistinguishable from a uniform distribution (or has a small deviation, Gini ≤ 0.10).",
            "decision_algorithms": "Miners decide how to allocate their energy budget (S) among occupying, mining, and defending plots. They also decide whether to challenge other miners for control of plots.",
            "specific_constraints": "Each plot can only be occupied by one miner at a time. Each miner can only occupy up to 10 plots (the total number of plots is 100). Miners can only mine up to 3 units of energy per plot per round. Any excess energy spent on mining is wasted.",
            "key1": "Miners can only occupy, mine, and defend plots within their energy budget (S)."
        }
    },
    "agent_types": {
        "MinerAgent": "An agent responsible for occupying, mining, and defending plots on the grid to maximize gold production within its energy budget.",
        "PlotResource": "A static agent representing a plot on the grid that can produce gold and be occupied by a miner, with properties that limit mining and defense actions."
