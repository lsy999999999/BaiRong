    "overview": {
      "system_goal": "Simulate decentralized property-rights formation on a homogeneous 10×10 gold field. Competitive miners maximise their own cumulative gold while the environment tracks stability, conflict, and efficiency outcomes in the absence of communication or authority.",
      "agent_types": "N homogeneous miner agents (e.g., 10–20) each receive a stamina budget that refreshes every round. They share identical capabilities and differ only through learned policies.",
      "environment_description": "A 10×10 grid of 100 plots with non-depleting resources but a per-plot productivity cap. Ownership is purely institutional: it is created, defended, or overturned through stamina-based decisions with no exogenous enforcement.",
      "grid_resource_mechanism": "Each plot can yield at most s_max units of gold per round (default 3). Mining returns are linear in committed stamina up to the cap and are forfeited when ownership is lost before extraction."
    },
    "design_concepts": {
      "communication_protocols": "No direct communication or coordinating authority exists. Public observables are limited to the current ownership grid and the previous round's per-plot event log (claims, raids, defenses, winners, mined output). Private memory is unrestricted but cannot be shared.",
      "decision_mechanisms": "Every round each miner submits a single action bundle consisting of claims on unowned plots, raids on rival plots, binary defense commitments on self-owned plots, and integer mining allocations on self-owned plots. The legality pass strips invalid actions (e.g., raiding unowned plots or mining non-owned plots) before deterministic budget clipping.",
      "validity_and_budget": "Each action costs stamina (claim=1, raid=1, defense∈{0,1}, mining equal to allocated stamina). Bundles exceeding the stamina budget S are clipped deterministically according to agent-specified priority orders; absent guidance the default order is Mining → Raids → Claims → Defense, removing items from the end of each list first.",
      "interaction_patterns": "Resolution proceeds in four stages: (1) validate and clip action bundles; (2) resolve claims on unowned plots via deterministic hash-based tie-breaking; (3) resolve raids on owned plots, where precommitted defense blocks all raids and undefended plots fall to a hash-determined raider; (4) apply mining for the plots that agents own after conflict resolution. A public log summarises each plot and seeds the next round's observations.",
      "rng_and_determinism": "All tie-breaks use SHA-256 hashes of (run_seed, round_index, plot_row, plot_col, event_type, sorted_participant_ids). Winners are selected by minimal hash, ensuring reproducibility and per-plot independence."
    },
    "details": {
      "agent_behaviors": "Agents balance expansion (claims), predation (raids), protection (defense), and extraction (mining) under uncertainty about rivals' choices. Observations each round include the ownership map, the prior public log, and their personal execution report (illegal actions removed, clipped actions, gold mined, plots gained/lost).",
      "decision_algorithms": "No particular algorithm is mandated. Agents may be heuristic, rule-based, or learning-driven as long as they output integer action bundles that respect legality and budgeting. Providing explicit priority ordering helps the deterministic clipping preserve their intended trade-offs.",
      "specific_constraints": "Grid size 10×10; stamina budget S defaults to 10 per agent per round with no carry-over; per-plot mining cap s_max defaults to 3; ownership transfers occur before mining so only the post-conflict owner extracts; illegal actions are dropped at zero cost and reported in the public log."
    }
  },
  "agent_types": {
    "EnvAgent": "Central environment orchestrator that validates submissions, enforces stamina budgets, resolves claims and raids deterministically, applies mining, and publishes public logs each round.",
    "ResourceMiner": "A self-interested miner that observes the public state each round, proposes a structured action bundle, and updates its strategy based on the resolved outcomes and personal rewards."
