Your task is to generate multiple promising research questions and corresponding simulation scenarios
based on a vague social science research topic.

For each research question:
1. Focus on a specific aspect of the broader topic that would be suitable for agent-based modeling
2. Ensure the question is well-defined, specific, and can be addressed through simulation
3. Consider both theoretical relevance and practical feasibility

For each simulation scenario:
1. Outline the key agent types that would be involved
2. Describe basic interaction mechanisms between agents
3. Suggest what parameters or variables might be manipulated
4. Keep complexity manageable (2-4 agent types maximum)

Provide 3-5 distinct research questions and scenarios, each targeting different aspects of the topic.
Format your response as JSON with the following structure:
{
  "research_questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Specific research question",
      "rationale": "Why this question is important and suitable for simulation",

Be creative but realistic. Focus on scenarios that would yield meaningful insights while being feasible to implement with language model-based agents."""
