"""
Experimental Design Package.

This package provides a framework for generating detailed simulation specifications
from vague social science research topics using a multi-agent collaboration approach.

The framework consists of four main agents:
1. InspirationAgent: Generates multiple potential research questions and scenarios
2. EvaluatorAgent: Evaluates and selects the most promising scenario
3. DetailerAgent: Elaborates the selected scenario into a detailed specification
4. AssessorAgent: Evaluates the quality of the conversion from brief description to ODD protocol

These agents are coordinated by the Coordinator class, which manages the workflow.
