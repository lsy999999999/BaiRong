## What Makes YuLan-OneSim Special

YuLan-OneSim bridges the gap between social science and artificial intelligence by offering a powerful, intuitive platform for research and exploration. Our framework enables researchers to:

- **Design simulations through natural language** - No coding required
- **Access 50+ built-in scenarios** across 8 major social science domains
- **Scale to 100,000+ agents** with distributed architecture
- **Generate research reports automatically** using AI
