# What is YuLan-OneSim

YuLan-OneSim (玉兰-万象) is a groundbreaking social simulator that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents to model human social behaviors. Our framework bridges the gap between social science and artificial intelligence by offering a powerful, user-friendly platform for research and exploration.

## Core Value Proposition

YuLan-OneSim represents the next generation of social simulation platforms, designed to make complex social research accessible, scalable, and scientifically rigorous. Unlike traditional simulation tools, our platform harnesses the power of Large Language Models to create intelligent agents capable of realistic human-like interactions and decision-making.

## What Makes YuLan-OneSim Special

YuLan-OneSim stands out as a next-generation social simulation platform driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Here's what makes it truly special:


### 🔄 **Code-free scenario construction**

Design complex simulations through natural language conversations—no programming required. The system automatically formalizes the input, builds agent behavior graphs, and generates executable code.


### 📚 **Comprehensive default scenarios**

50+ default scenarios across 8 major social science domains (e.g., economics, sociology, politics, psychology, communication), offering out-of-the-box simulations grounded in well-established social science theories.


### 🧠 **Evolvable simulation**

Models that automatically improve based on external feedback. Powered by the **Verifier–Reasoner–Refiner–Tuner (VR²T)** framework, YuLan-OneSim can incorporate feedback from users or automated validators to improve its underlying LLMs over time.


### 🚀 **Large-scale simulation**

Distributed architecture supporting up to **100,000 agents** with an event-driven architecture, it can simulate complex, dynamic societies at scale—mirroring real-world complexity far better than traditional rule-based simulators.


### 🔍 **AI social researcher**

Autonomous research from topic proposal to report generation. You provide a research question, and the system automatically handles experiment design, scenario building, simulation execution, result analysis, and technical report writing.
